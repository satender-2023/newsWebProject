                More and more companies are realising the importance of short breaks for employees and the effect it can have on their overall productivity. Various studies on the internet talk about the benefits of taking a day off to recharge. And what could be better than your company asking you to take not one, but 9 full days off from work in order to recharge. A tech company did just that and is being praised of the internet for this move. Kudos to the management team for thinking of employees' comfort in times when major companies are conducting large-scale layoffs to cut down on costs.
