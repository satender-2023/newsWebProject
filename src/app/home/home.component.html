                            News247 is an Indian media company launched in May 2010, focusing on broadcast and digital
                            news publication. The company is considered to be a legacy brand that pioneered independent
                            news broadcasting in India, and is credited for launching the first 24x7 news channel and
                            the first lifestyle channel in the country.

                           News247 came into existence in December 2011 as an independent digital
                            news publication company and then it became the first complete English digital news publication company
                            in the country to be broadcast twenty-four hours. The tagline for News247 was "Yeh thi news aaj tak, Intzar kijiye kal tak" (transl.â€‰That's all the news for today, wait until tomorrow).

                            By the time the channel came into existence, it had a reach of 52 lakh subscribers and since then it has become the channel to broadcast in three crore households and its viewership in news channels is 56%. On 14 December 2015, News247 launched India's first Hindi high-definition digital news, News247 HD. A company rebranding took place in January 2018.

                            All of News247 channels, including News247 HD, were gradually revamped throughout the second half of 2020, beginning with the renaming of parent-subsidiary News247 Network to News247 HD in July 2020.A further rebranding, which affected the channels themselves, took place in the morning of 16 December 2021, with the launch of simpler, more modern logos and a new graphics package developed by Saffron Brand Consultants for all of News247 channels. Additionally, ABP News acquired new equipment able to record content at 1080p and launched its own HD feed; the channel's SD feed turned into a downscaled, 16:9 widescreen version of the HD feed. Prior to the HD feed launch, ABP News had launched a test HD feed in February of that same year, exclusively on satellite provider Hotstar and on ABP's online platforms, which was basically an upscaled version of the SD channel airing 4:3 content stretched to fill the 16:9 screen.[citation needed] Although News247 Network's regional language channels were also rebranded, they remained airing at 4:3 standard definition.
