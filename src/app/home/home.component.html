                            break, declares 9 days paid time off for all</a>
                    </p>
                    <p class="thumb-card-para">
                        More and more companies are realising the importance of short breaks for employees and the
                        effect it can have on their overall productivity. Various studies on the internet talk about the
                        benefits of taking a day off to recharge. And what could be better than your company asking you
                        to take not one, but 9 full days off from work in order to recharge. A tech company did just
                        that and is being praised of the internet for this move. Kudos to the management team for
                        thinking of employees' comfort in times when major companies are conducting large-scale layoffs
                        to cut down on costs.

                            completes 16th close approach to Sun, appears unharmed
                        </a>

                    <p class="thumb-card-para">
                        NASA’s Parker Solar Probe completed its 16th orbit around the Sun, which included a close
                        approach to the Sun on June 22, 2023, said the space agency. During the close approach, Parker
                        came within 8.5 million kilometres of the Sun’s surface while moving at around 586,782
                        kilometres per hour. The spacecraft seemed to be operating normally without any issues after
                        completing the close flyby.

                        Parker is touted as humanity’s first ever mission that “visited” a star. The spacecraft is about
                        the size of a small car and can travel directly through the Sun’s atmosphere. It was launched
                        from Cape Canaveral in Florida on August 12, 2018.

                        The spacecraft and its instruments are protected from the heat of the Sun by a 4.5-inch thick
                        carbon composite shield that can withstand temperatures of around 1,777 degrees Celsius.
                        Parker’s primary science goals including tracing how energy and heat move through the corona and
                        to explore what causes the acceleration of solar winds and solar energetic particles.
